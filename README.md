Traffic Accident Prediction Using SUMO and Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a simulation-driven framework for predicting rear-end traffic collisions using traffic flow insights and machine learning techniques. Due to the lack of large-scale real-world traffic accident datasets, the system leverages SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) to generate realistic traffic scenarios and sensor-based data for accident prediction.

The framework focuses on time-series traffic data analysis and evaluates both traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches to accurately identify accident-prone situations in highly imbalanced datasets.

Simulate realistic traffic environments and rear-end collision scenarios using SUMO

Extract and preprocess sensor-level traffic flow features

Apply machine learning and deep learning models for accident prediction

Handle severe class imbalance using appropriate sampling techniques
